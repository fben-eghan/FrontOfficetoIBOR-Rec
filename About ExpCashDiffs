The output of this stored procedure would be a table containing the cash differences between the "Front Office" system and the "IBOR" system for each portfolio and currency.
The table would have columns for "Portfolio," "CCY," "Portia" (the amount from the Front Office system),
"POMS" (the amount from the IBOR system), and "Rec Difference" (the reconciliation difference between the two systems).

Here is an example output:

IJKLMNOP	USD	800.00	800.00	0.00
JKLMNOPQ	EUR	200.00	220.00	-20.00
